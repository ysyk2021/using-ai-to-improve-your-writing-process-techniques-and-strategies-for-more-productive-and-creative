# Introduction

Have you ever set a goal that you were unable to achieve? Maybe you wanted to lose weight, learn a new language, or start your own business. You were excited and motivated at first, but as time went on, you lost steam and eventually gave up.

Setting goals is easy. Achieving them is hard. But why is that? Why do some people seem to effortlessly achieve their goals while others struggle to make any progress?

The truth is that setting goals is only the first step. To achieve your goals, you need a plan. You need to know what steps to take, when to take them, and how to stay motivated along the way.

That's where this book comes in.
